\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
An increasingly popular pattern in the Virtual Observatory, pioneered
by Obscore, is to define a schema for one or more tables in a database
and then publish data by making it accessible in tables conforming to
that schema in TAP services.  This document discusses how such resources
should be represented in the VO Registry to facilitate data discovery,
in particular global, all-VO data discovery.

It turns out that the existing registration patterns for Obscore,
RegTAP, and EPN-TAP require some adjustments.  The document therefore
also proposes transition strategies for these.

The words ``MUST'', ``SHALL'', ``SHOULD'', ``MAY'', ``RECOMMENDED'', and
``OPTIONAL'' (in upper or lower case) used in this document are to be
interpreted as described in IETF standard RFC2119 \citep{std:RFC2119}.

The \emph{Virtual Observatory (VO)} is a
general term for a collection of federated resources that can be used
to conduct astronomical research, education, and outreach.
The \href{https://www.ivoa.net}{International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)} is a global
collaboration of separately funded projects to develop standards and
infrastructure that enable VO applications.


\section{Introduction}

Beginning with Obscore 1.0 \citep{2011ivoa.spec.1028T}, an increasing
number of Virtual Observatory standards at their core just define a
table schema -- understood here as a well-defined set of columns within
one or more relations -- and rely on TAP \citep{2019ivoa.spec.0927D} to
let clients actually run queries.  Standards of this type include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Obscore \citep{2017ivoa.spec.0509L} -- a table for metadata of
observational data products
\item RegTAP \citep{2019ivoa.spec.1011D} -- a 13-table schema with
metadata of VO resources
\item ObsLocTAP \citep{2021ivoa.spec.0724S} -- a table schema to
communicate plans for observations and metadata of completed
observations
\item EPN-TAP \citep{2022ivoa.spec.0822E} -- a table schema for solar
system data
\end{itemize}

More such standards are currently being developed. Examples include LineTAP
\citep{wd:linetap23} and the Obscore extension for radio data.

Of course, resources complying to these standards must be made
discoverable to be useful.  Both Obscore and RegTAP have employed the
\xmlel{dataModel} element specifically introduced into TAPRegExt
\citep{2012ivoa.spec.0827D} to declare the presence of tables adhering
to a standard schema in a TAP service.

Both Obscore and RegTAP are singletons with fixed names, i.e., once one
has discovered a TAP service ``supporting'' a data model, it is clear
how to query it.  However, even for these, the \xmlel{dataModel}-scheme
has severe shortcomings:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lack of resource metadata: In resource records located during
discovery, the global VOResource metadata (title, authors, and perhaps
most importantly coverage in space, time and spectrum) are these of the
TAP service, which the tables may share with any number of other tables.

\item Unclear relationships: In particular for Obscore -- rather
typically serving several data collections at once --, a serious
problem is that data collection records can only generically say
that they are served by the TAP service (cf.~\citet{2019ivoa.spec.0520D}
for the general scheme of relating data collections and services).  From
that, clients cannot deduce whether the data is available through, say,
obscore, or only in some custom table.

\item Suitability: Adherence to a data model simply is not a property of a
TAP service.  It is a property of a specific table or schema.
\end{enumerate}

EPN-TAP then employed the table-in-TAP scheme without the constraint to
a singleton; since each data collection has an EPN-TAP table of its own,
the discovery process somehow also had to yield a table name.  As a
solution, the standard forsees using the table's \xmlel{utype} field in
the VODataService \citep{2010ivoa.spec.1202P} \xmlel{tableset}.

This mode of discovery was subsequently also employed in ObsLocTAP and
LineTAP.  It still has a drawback, though: Clients discovering a service
with a \xmlel{table} (or \xmlel{schema} in the case of RegTAP) with the
bespoke \xmlel{utype} have a hard time determining whether what they
have found is the data collection's record (and hence the global
metadata pertains to the data collection itself) or the record of the
TAP service serving the data collection (in which case the global
metadata pertains to the TAP service and will be essentially unrelated
to the data collection in question).

This note remedies that by prescribing that for resource records for
standard-compliant tables, the resource type \xmlel{vs:CatalogResource}
must be used.

In Sect.~\ref{sect:norms}, we review the proposed scheme and give
boilerplate text to include in standards following it.  One reason to
introduce the scheme is to enable expressing inclusion relationships
between resources for the benefit of clients doing global discovery.
Sect.~\ref{sect:rels} discusses this mechanism in more detail.  Finally,
Sect.~\ref{sect:transition} addresses the question of how to transition
from what the standards currently say (and the services and clients
implement) to a VO adopting the scheme proposed here.

\section{Registering and Discovering Standard Tables}
\label{sect:norms}

In the scheme proposed here, TAP-queriable resources conforming to
standard table schemas will be registered as
\xmlel{vs:CatalogResource}-typed Resources.  If they consist of only a
single table or of multiple, independently publishable tables (e.g.,
Obscore, EPN-TAP), an IVOA identifier \citep{2016ivoa.spec.0523D} is
defined for this particular table.  This will refer to a StandardsRegExt
\citep{2012ivoa.spec.0508H} \xmlel{StandardKey}, generally in the
defining standard's resource record.  This standard key SHOULD contain a
version tag precise to the minor version; it is at least conceivable
that clients may only want to discover tables containing later
additions.

Hence, the VODataService \xmlel{table} element for a table conforming to
Obscore 1.2 would begin like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
<table>
  <name>ivoa.obscore</name>
  <title>Obscore Table in the Fictional Data Centre</title>
  <description>
    This is example metadata for use in the
    TableReg specification.
  </description>
  <utype>ivo://ivoa.net/std/obscore#table-1.2</utype>
  ...
\end{lstlisting}
where Obscore's StandardsRegExt record contains a fragment:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
<key>
  <name>table-1.2</name>
  <description>The data model for a table conforming to version 1.2
  of this specification.  This implies a set of nn mandatory columns,
  as well as the table's name, ivoa.obscore.
  </description>
</key>
\end{lstlisting}

Standards defining full schemas, i.e., sets of interconnected tables
that only make sense together -- at the moment, RegTAP is our only
example -- will similarly define a StandardKey to use with a schema
element.  The RegTAP registry record currently has:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
<key>
  <name>1.1</name>
  <description>The data model for the tables making up the relational
  registriy in version 1.1.  This key is used to locate TAP services
  implementing RR in TAPRegExt dataModel or VODataService schema/@utype
  elements.
  </description>
</key>
\end{lstlisting}

Hence, the tableset of the record for the Heidelberg RegTAP service
\nolinkurl{ivo://org.gavo.dc/rr/q/create} contains:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
<schema>
   <name>rr</name>
   <title>GAVO RegTAP Service</title>
   <description>
     Tables containing the information in the IVOA Registry[...]
   <utype>ivo://ivoa.net/std/RegTAP#1.1</utype>
   <table>...
\end{lstlisting}

It is not recommended to follow the RegTAP's example of omitting an
indicator of what is referred to in the standard key's name.  Hence,
prefer, for instance, \verb|schema-1.1| to \verb|1.1|; it is always
conceivable that additional versioned entities may require standard
keys.

Let us already stress here that for standard discovery, the minor
version must be ignored.  Clients should be written such that if they
work for any 1.x version, they work for all 1.x versions, except of
course where compelling reasons exist to require features not present in
earlier minor versions.

An important reason to enumerate resources conforming to a schema is
global discovery.
